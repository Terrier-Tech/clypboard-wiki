In order to make the language a bit more friendly, there are a number of commonly-used functions that have been added to native Javascript types:

### capitalize :: string -> string
Capitalizes only the first letter of the string

### formatCents(showCents=true) :: string|number -> string
Converts a cents value into dollars, adds the dollar sign, and formats the decimal to show two places (or hides it if showCents=false)

### titleize :: string -> string
Capitalizes the first letter of every word
